How to use python with mongo database using pymongo
About Mongo DB
mongo db is basically a no sql database which is divided into three categories
1. Databases
2. Collections (each database consists of multiple collections) (like tables in sql)
3. Documents (actual data in key value pairs) (like a tuple or row of table in sql)
4. Field (key value pair documents key field) (like column in sql tables)

Note - Mongo DB creates an _id for each and every document by itself

How to connect python with mongo db
1. create a client using pymongo.MongoClient
2. then create a database using above created clients
3. now as database is created create collections using above database
4. after collections are created you can now insert dictionary objects into this created collections


Some important methods used in python with mongo db
1. list_database_names = returns a python list with all database names 
2. insert = returns id of the inserted document
3. insert_one = this will insert one dict object as a document into collection
4. insert_many = this will insert all objects from an array of object as document into collection and returns a list of inserted ids
5. as mongo db creates an _id for each document on its own this _id can be explicitly specified for each document by adding an extra field key - value pair of
   "_id": "value" into dict object which is to be inserted as a document into mongo db collection. however the value of this _id key must be unique.
6. find = returns a list of object of all documents in a collection that is each object is basically a document or a record of collection
7. find method also has a second optional parameter describing which fields to include from the documents in collections
8. first argument of find takes an object which is used to limit the search that is search only those documents which we want
